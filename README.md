# Bachelor_STM32_code
All STM32 microcontroller code for the Audiograb bachelor project.

The Audiograb-dev folder contains the STM32CubeIDE project for the STM32H7B3I-DK devkit, which was used for development before the hardware prototype was designed and produced.

The Audiograb folder contains the STM32CubeIDE project for the hardware prototype which was designed during the bachelor. It has mostly been set up using STM32CubeMX, but the code from Audiograb-dev has not yet been ported.

The Pico_SPI_master folder contains the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK project, used with a Raspberry Pi Pico W (or similar) to send SD commands over the SPI bus for testing.

The Test_projects folder contains projects developed to get familiar with the STM32H7 microcontroller family.
